    title: Fix Overflows in the Overview
    contentMarkdown: |-
      You seem to be having issues with overflows in the overview.
      This may be because the thumbnails provide to little space for the widget being displayed.

      There are several ways in which you can control the presentation of the thumbnail,
      including setting the scale, which can effectively give the widget more space.

      To learn about these, read the
      [Overview](https://pub.dev/documentation/werkbank/latest/topics/Overview-topic.html)
      topic in the API docs.

      Alternatively, explore the methods yourself by typing `c.overview.` in your use case
      and autocompleting the methods that are available.

    contentWithConstraintsAddonMarkdown: |-
      @:overview.overflow_notification.contentMarkdown

      Additionally, since you are using the `ConstraintsAddon`, note that the lower bounds given to
      `c.constraints.supported(...)` also set the minimum size that is used for the thumbnail
      unless `limitOverviewSize` is set to `false`.
      Also by using for example `c.constraints.overview(...)` you can set the view constraints
      that are used in the overview. If this is not set, the view constraints used in the
      overview falls back to the initial view constraints that are also used when
      viewing the use case.
